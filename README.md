# TestCourseApp
Just an app to test on some things. I'm using prism for readeability and maintainability. Feel free to give me suggestion and idea, and thank you.

Inside:
- Keypad, which auto separate numbers (from microsoft documentation)
- a qr code scanner (using ZXing.Net.Mobile)
- a media and camera picker (using Xam.Plugin.Media)
- a ListView of monkeys (from microsoft documentation)
- a mini contact app using SQLite (from free course, using sqlite-pcl-net)

I'm using Acr.UserDialogs inside.
You can also tell me what to test, and sorry for the broken documentaion. Any tips would be a great help!
Note: iOS is not fully tested, i got no device to do it.
