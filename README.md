# TestCourseApp
Just an app to test on some things. I'm using prism for readeability and maintainability. Feel free to give me suggestion and idea, and thank you.

Inside:
- Keypad, which auto separate numbers (from microsoft documentation)
- a qr code scanner (using ZXing.Net.Mobile)
- a media and camera picker (using Xam.Plugin.Media)
- a ListView of monkeys (from microsoft documentation)
- a mini contact app using SQLite (from free course, using sqlite-pcl-net)
- a localization page to change app language (english and indonesia), only some text in main menu and localization page tho. Along with localized time picker and date picker (from xamgirl blog "Mastering Multilingual in Xamarin.Forms")
- a page to call for local notification. click on the notification to see the message on the page (from microsoft documentation)

I'm using Acr.UserDialogs inside.
You can also tell me what to test, and sorry for the broken documentaion. Any tips would be a great help!
Note: iOS is not fully tested, i got no device to do it.
